# odin-recipes
HTML First Project

The first project on The Odin Project, is to create a website with recipes. 

First, I created the index.html file. From there I followed the steps outlined on TOP. 
I found a recipe that I liked and created chickentikkamasala.html. I follwed the steps of the assignment on what to include. 
From there, I found another recipe and created the koreangroundbeefbowl.html.
For the fourth and final recipe, I added the steak.html.

I linked them all in the index.html file to ensure that the pages would work correctly. 

Thanks to The Odin Project for this amazing FREE content.
